### Contributing
This toolbox is a collaborative effort from several chairs of the Technical University of Munich, namely
the Professorship of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the Professorship of Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) 
and the Professorship of Automotive Enginnering (FTM). We especially like to thank the entire Indy Autonomous Team
of TUM for their code base.
